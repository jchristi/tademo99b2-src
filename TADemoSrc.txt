So what is everything in here?

Folder  	what it is
---------------------------
Root		Contains several files that are shared among all the 
		sub-applications, and also a project that builds a basic 
		directplay/ta packet logger.
CRC		Calculated and writes a CRC value to dplay.xll which is then
		checked on every startup to prevent tampering.
DDraw		The DLL that provides the interface upgrade and TAHook and 
		probably even more such as 3dta-stuff.
Docs		Various texts on packet structures and things like that. Some 
		of the texts are in swedish.
IDAnalyze	Utility to find the 32bit "id" of a unit from a saved unit
		restriction list. This number can be used in the unitid.txt
		used by the replayer.
Installer	Nullsoft Installer script that creates the installation program.
Recorder	Builds dplayx.dll which is the main part of the recorder.
Server		Replays demo files.
VisPatcher	Launched by the installer if the user is running windows 95.
		Patches totala.exe to load spank.dll instead of ddraw.dll.
