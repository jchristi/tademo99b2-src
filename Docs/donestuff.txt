
--- stuff that is done ---

* Installer now install in the TA Dir you type instead of the default.. heh

* The game progress indicator is now movable. So you can skip to anywhere in the game. Note that this only
  affects units and their positions really, so any DT's for example that were built in the skipped time will
  therefore NOT be visible. Same goes for wreckage, reclaimable features, etc. Not much to do about that. 
  Better than nothing. :)

* Current Ack Status... fixed. Or rather, if you see it, decrease Sync Speed from the Options screen.

* Memory Leak is now gone

* Unit sync now works as intended (dont ask :p)

* Double-clicked files in explorer now works correctly

* Added an Options screen.

* Listing of units that were used in the game
