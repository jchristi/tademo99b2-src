Ok here's stuff that I want to add.
-------------------------------------------


* Correct unitsync
You mean no CRC errors?
> Partly that, and well, I assumed some stuff that really was.. well completely wrong. :) The reported 
"missings units" has no meaning at all.

* Listing of units that were used in the game
Incl. 3rd party?
> not now, mostly those 3 extras. But I'm thinking of doing something "open" so that ppl can add the signatures
> of 3rd-party to a textfile.. but I dunno. maybe next version. :)

* No more memory leaks
Cool, important

* use better timer routines
Hm?
> windows offer some that are much more exact, but it produced weird effects last time. :) So we just didn't care
> to find the problem..

* Setting los to Perm so ppl can join as real players instead of watchers, so you can discuss a played-back game
Uhm, whatever works, sure

* Making the game-pos indicator moveable so you can at least fast-forward. (rewind may be hard)
This would be cool, but as far as I understand, you record momvement orders, not their actual movements? Maybe some kind of added utility to convert a .tad file into a .mpg? that would be very cool
> yes, but the positions are transmitted regularly so it would probably stabilize after a min or so
> if we just skip ahead in the packet-list..at least in theory. :)

* MPlayer support (or at least not MPlayer crashing. But. well.. MPlayer sucks, so maybe it's good as it is. :))
hehe, ok

* Continuous loading of recorded file -> less memory being used + faster loadtimes
cool

* supporting Pause key
cool

* fix that "current ack status xxx of xxx" that some ppl see
cool, afaik it happens when ppl choose IPX. it works using tcp/ip instead, but that means one has to be online, or simulate things
> heh, I use ipx all the time. :) but I finally reproduced that error in my win95 so it should be easy to fix.

* Fix the handling of double-clicked-files in explorer.. doesn't work very good right now.
ok

* Send some keep-alive stuff so watchers dont drop -> see stats for everyone

--- stuff that is done ---

* Installer now install in the TA Dir you type instead of the default.. heh

* The game progress indicator is now movable. So you can skip to anywhere in the game. Note that this only
  affects units and their positions really, so any DT's for example that were built in the skipped time will
  therefore NOT be visible. Same goes for wreckade, reclaimable features, etc. Not much to do about that. 
  Better than nothing. :)

* Current Ack Status... fixed. Or rather, if you see it, decrease Sync Speed from the Options screen.

* Memory Leak - The Story: Seems like it is caused by DirectPlay. Commenting out the one call to dp->Send fixes
  the leak. So not much we can do about it.. (TA seems to leak mem at about the same rate as the server.exe, so
  it's probably all microsofts fault)

* Unit sync now works as intended (dont ask :p)




--- SJ-Bugs (tm) ---

* Adding comments updates file info window


--- SJ-work ---

have you solved the problem of playing a game while recording, then exiting to menu and starting again and recording a different filename, causing TA to crash with illegal operation while loading?

 think you should look more into protecting the code from hampering

I can imagine some ppl wanting to change the code so that the recorder doesn't reveal it's presence, f.ex., and having more than 3 seconds invulnerability on new untis

some kind of encryption



checksum

hey, found a bug in the new recorder.  When I go into comment and click add without entering text it locks....just an FYI..



eyy, bugreport svenne...

när man kollat klart på ett game asså när man vunnit o den ska köra över till slutskärmen med poäng mm så krashar båre servern o TA så att man får kicka dem med aktivitetshanteraren...

othuur eller är det bara på min maskin? jag kör NT o har en P120 med 24 Mb ram but hey... VM makes up for it i heard

got an idea for a possible future version....how about displaying the length of the game.... (like the clock if at normal game speed)...of course would have to be approx....


heh, got another.  How about displaying starting resources....
