; TA Demo Recoder 0.90ß.
;
; This file describes different groups of units.
; You can therefore add 3rd party units etc to this list if you feel like.
;
; The hex-number <unitid> is the same number that is saved in a unit restrictions file. Don't know
; how that is related to the unit, or if it can be found in the unit's file somewhere. So if
; you know, feel free to enlighten me.
;
; If you add stuff to the file, you could always send it to me so that future releases of TA Demo can
; recognize what 3rd-party units was used. (If there should happen to be a nice easy way to get the unit
; names from those id numbers, this file might become obsolete)

; Syntax: (very simple)
;
; = <group name / unit name>
; <unitid>
; <unitid>
; <...>
;
; = <group name>
;
; etc..
;
; update: only units in one of the +-groups will show. with the group furthest down takes presedence.
;         however, the units before the first +-group will be tested for all groups

; I just added one unit to CC cuz I'm lazy. Btw, it's inclusive, so if any unit in the groups list were
; enabled in the game, this group's name will be listed under used units.
